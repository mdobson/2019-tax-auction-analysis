Matthew Dobson's Final Project for Stata Practicum

This is my final project for the Stata Practicum course that aims to analyze different factors of the 2017 Wayne County Tax Foreclosure Auction.

It expects that the following packages will be activated/installed:

- grmap
- spshape2dta
- tabout
- outreg2

To get started edit the file in this directory titled main. On line 7 you need to define the base path to the directory. This will setup the current working directory.

**Update this line with the location of the current working directory
global root "/Users/mdobs/Desktop/stata_practicum/final_project"

A brief explanation of top level folders and files in this stata project:
